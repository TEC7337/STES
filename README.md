# Smart Time Entry System (STES)

A Python-based automated employee time tracking system using face recognition and computer vision technologies. Built for Nsight Inc. internship demonstration.

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-time Face Recognition**: Uses webcam to detect and recognize employee faces
- **Automated Time Logging**: Automatically logs clock-in and clock-out timestamps
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents duplicate entries with configurable cooldown period
- **SQL Database Integration**: Stores time logs in PostgreSQL or SQLite
- **Streamlit Web Interface**: Modern web UI for real-time monitoring
- **Employee Registration**: Easy utility to add new employees to the system
- **Tableau Integration**: Optional dashboard visualization (future enhancement)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**: Core programming language
- **OpenCV**: Computer vision and image processing
- **face_recognition**: Face detection and recognition (dlib-based)
- **SQLAlchemy**: Database ORM
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework
- **pandas**: Data analysis and manipulation
- **PostgreSQL/SQLite**: Database storage
- **Tableau**: Data visualization (optional)

```

## 🔧 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd STES
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up the database:**
   ```bash
   python db/setup_database.py
   ```

4. **Configure the application:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Update configuration values as needed

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Register employees:**
   ```bash
   python utils/register_employee.py
   ```

2. **Run the Streamlit application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run ui/main.py
   ```

3. **Access the web interface:**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

## ⚙️ Configuration

Key configuration options in `config/config.py`:

- `FACE_RECOGNITION_TOLERANCE`: Sensitivity of face recognition (0.6 default)
- `COOLDOWN_MINUTES`: Minimum time between clock-in/out (10 minutes default)
- `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection string
- `CAMERA_INDEX`: Which camera to use (0 for default)

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Initialization**: System loads saved face encodings of known employees
2. **Detection**: Webcam continuously scans for faces in real-time
3. **Recognition**: When a face is detected, it's compared against known encodings
4. **Logging**: 
   - First recognition of the day → Clock-in
   - Subsequent recognition after cooldown → Clock-out
5. **Storage**: Timestamps stored in SQL database with duplicate prevention

## 🗄️ Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE time_logs (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    clock_in TIMESTAMP,
    clock_out TIMESTAMP,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE employees (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    face_encoding TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## 🔍 Demo and Testing

The system includes sample employee data for testing:
- Mock employee photos in `data/employee_photos/`
- Pre-computed face encodings in `data/face_encodings.pkl`
- Test database with sample records
