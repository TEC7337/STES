# Smart Time Entry System (STES)

A Python-based automated employee time tracking system using face recognition and computer vision technologies. Built for Nsight Inc. internship demonstration.

## üöÄ Features

- **Real-time Face Recognition**: Uses webcam to detect and recognize employee faces
- **Automated Time Logging**: Automatically logs clock-in and clock-out timestamps
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents duplicate entries with configurable cooldown period
- **SQL Database Integration**: Stores time logs in PostgreSQL or SQLite
- **Streamlit Web Interface**: Modern web UI for real-time monitoring
- **Employee Registration**: Easy utility to add new employees to the system
- **Tableau Integration**: Optional dashboard visualization (future enhancement)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**: Core programming language
- **OpenCV**: Computer vision and image processing
- **face_recognition**: Face detection and recognition (dlib-based)
- **SQLAlchemy**: Database ORM
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework
- **pandas**: Data analysis and manipulation
- **PostgreSQL/SQLite**: Database storage
- **Tableau**: Data visualization (optional)

## üîß Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd STES
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install face_recognition and dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install cmake

   ```

4. **Set up the database:**
   ```bash
   python db/setup_database.py
   ```

5. **Configure the application:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Update configuration values as needed

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Register employees:**
   ```bash
   python utils/register_employee.py
   ```

2. **Run the Streamlit application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run ui/main.py
   ```

3. **Access the web interface:**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'face_recognition'

If you see this error, the `face_recognition` library is not installed. Install it and its dependencies with:

```bash
pip install face_recognition
```

If you encounter issues installing `face_recognition`, you may need to install `cmake`, `dlib`, and build tools:

- On Windows:
  ```bash
  pip install cmake
  pip install dlib
  pip install face_recognition
  ```
  You may also need to install Visual C++ Build Tools from [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).

- On Linux:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake
  pip install dlib
  pip install face_recognition
  ```

For more help, see the [face_recognition installation guide](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition#installation).

### dlib build fails with "CMake is not installed on your system!"

If you see an error like:

```
CMake is not installed on your system!
...
```

This means the official CMake is not installed or not on your system PATH.  
**Solution:**
1. Download and install the official CMake from [cmake.org](https://cmake.org/download/).
2. During installation, make sure to check the box to **Add CMake to the system PATH**.
3. After installation, open a new terminal and run:
   ```bash
   cmake --version
   ```
   If you see the version, CMake is installed correctly.

Now retry:
```bash
pip install dlib
pip install face_recognition
```

If you still have issues, ensure you have Visual C++ Build Tools installed (see above).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Key configuration options in `config/config.py`:

- `FACE_RECOGNITION_TOLERANCE`: Sensitivity of face recognition (0.6 default)
- `COOLDOWN_MINUTES`: Minimum time between clock-in/out (10 minutes default)
- `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection string
- `CAMERA_INDEX`: Which camera to use (0 for default)

## üéØ How It Works

1. **Initialization**: System loads saved face encodings of known employees
2. **Detection**: Webcam continuously scans for faces in real-time
3. **Recognition**: When a face is detected, it's compared against known encodings
4. **Logging**: 
   - First recognition of the day ‚Üí Clock-in
   - Subsequent recognition after cooldown ‚Üí Clock-out
5. **Storage**: Timestamps stored in SQL database with duplicate prevention

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE time_logs (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    clock_in TIMESTAMP,
    clock_out TIMESTAMP,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE employees (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    face_encoding TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## üîç Demo and Testing

The system includes sample employee data for testing:
- Mock employee photos in `data/employee_photos/`
- Pre-computed face encodings in `data/face_encodings.pkl`
- Test database with sample records
